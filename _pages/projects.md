# Course Projects

During my Bachelor's and Master's programs, I worked on short and focussed projects that helped me consolidate the concepts learned in coursework and gave me a broad idea about how research is conducted in that field.

### Optimal READ/WRITE schemes for Phase Change Memories - EE305A/B

### Fabrication of NMOS devices - EE291


# Club Projects

Working in student clubs at Center For Innovation was perhaps the most productive and beneficial part of an undergraduate program at IIT Madras.

### Device Engineer | May 2021 - Present 

As a part of the Test Chip Integration team, I examine transistor performance and isolation structures in _RibbonFETs_ as a key contributor towards R&D efforts into Intel's future technology nodes. 

On a daily basis, I work on building and optimizing test structures that probe into process margins and performance gains for a given node/product. Being a device engineer, I enjoy analyzing I-V characteristics, developing leakage models, and understanding inherent process in novel transistor architectures.

**Projects**:
1. **Intel 18A** - Currently working on a **Pathfinding Test Vehicle** for Intel's 18A node which is due beyond 2025.
2. **Intel 3** - In my first test chip project, I was involved in an **Enchancement Test Vehicle** for the Alder Lake processors. My task was to develop experiments through Physical Design to study crucial device physics - strained channel, DIBL, off-state leakage - affecting drive current and gain of FinFETs in that node. Being at a relatively matured stage, this technology node was a good lauchpad for making the transition from academia to industry.
