# Course Projects

During my Bachelor's and Master's programs, I worked on short and focussed projects that helped me consolidate the concepts learned in coursework and gave me a broad idea about how research is conducted in that field.

### Optimal READ/WRITE schemes for Phase Change Memories - EE305A/B

### Fabrication of NMOS devices - EE291


# Club Projects

Working in student clubs at Center For Innovation was perhaps the most productive and beneficial part of an undergraduate program at IIT Madras. 


# Master's Thesis

## Semi-empirical modeling of impact ionization in wide bandgap systems 
### PI: Prof. Srabanti Chowdhury | Sep '20 - May '21 | Stanford, CA

The scope of this project was limited to a theoretical study and model building due to the pandemic.

1. Identified discrepancies in voltage-dependent extraction of impact ionization coefficient a in synthetic diamond diodes in
experimental literature employing photomultiplication techniques on various device architectures
2. Proposed a **semi-empirical model** for a by fitting experimental data to a harmonic sum incorporating applied electric field,
electron momentum changes from E-k diagram during collisions, and electron-phonon interactions

# Patent

## Many-in-one wearable virtual musical instruments
### Indian Patent no. 481647 | Aug '16 - Feb '17 | Center for Innovation, IIT Madras

While working on for the annual tech fest at IIT Madras, a few friends and I decided to build **Indian musical instruments**. 

1. Patented gesture-controlled musical instruments with sensor-loaded gloves, eliminating the need for physical structures
2. Trained classification models to interpret hand and head movements and perform diverse instruments like violin, flute,
tabla, guitar, on a single pair of gloves
3. Performed live at the techno-cultural show **Envisage**, part of IIT Madras' Shaastra, which had a footfall of 4000+

# Bachelor's Thesis

## Design and fabrication of printed antennas in VHF and UHF range
### PIs: Prof. Parasuraman Swaminathan and Dr. Jan Schnitker | Aug '18 - May '19 | IIT Madras, is it fresh Aachen

This work was split into two main themes across 2 semesters. At IIT Madras, I worked on

1. Designed **co-planar waveguide-fed antennas** for GPS (1.575 GHz) and Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz) applications, using silver nanowire-based ink on FR-4 and thin PET substrates, achieving high gain with minimal return loss
2. Developed a flexible, transparent capacitive touch pad using silver nanowire-based ink that demonstrated **30 ohm/sq** and a **transmittance of 94% at 550 nm**
3. Published the results of this work in - **Nair, N. M., Daniel, K., Vadali, S. C., Ray, D., & Swaminathan, P. (2019). Direct writing of silver nanowire-based ink for flexible transparent capacitive touch pad. Flexible and Printed Electronics, 4(4), 045001. https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-8585/ab4b04**

In Aachen, I worked on

1. Enhanced NFC reading range for European Regional Developmental Fund's Packsense project, monitoring food freshness via **printed sensors** and NFC
coils through experimental work
2. Designed and fabricated various printed antenna configurations that led to **boost in NFC read-out distance by 200%** for NFC ISO14443 standards
3. Achieved a **sixfold reduction in bulk production costs** through innovative designs of high-resistance 50 nm Aluminum on PET NFC tags

# Course Projects

## Partial RESET-based WRITE strategies for Multi-level Cell (MLC) in Phase-Change Memories (PCM)
### EE309A/B: Semiconductor memory devices and circuit design | Sep '20 - Mar '21 | Stanford

I still use the Airpods Pro that I won from this project!

1. Developed a novel **multi-step WRITE strategy** for MLC in **GeSeTe-based PCMs** to minimize energy-delay product
2. Won the **Best Project Award sponsored by Apple** in an advanced graduate class of over 40 students for demonstrating
faster, energy-efficient MLC capability with significant potential for memory-intensive AI applications
3. Determined optimal number of steps and step sizes for achieving the desired resistance (LSB) by analyzing the
thermodynamics (energy) and crystallization kinetics (latency) of phase changes in GeSeTe
4. Simulated this WRITE strategy on a specific array size using **NVSim/DESTINY**, with experimental results matching
energy-delay product to inherently faster but less area-efficient single-bit PCM cells

# Student Club Projects

## Indoor Positioning System using Wi-Fi
### Electronics Club | Mar '16 - Oct '16 Center For Innovation, IIT Madras 

This was my first ever foray into electronics and engineering. 

1. Engineered an **indoor positioning system** using the $5 WiFi-enabled ESP8266-01 IoT13 module, achieving 1-2 m accuracy
2. Achieved a **10x cost reduction**, **3x form factor reduction** versus existing solutions, prompting interest from TVS Motor Company for warehouse inventory tracking implementation
3. Built a self-localizing robot mapping Wi-Fi nodes in a room using a **projections onto convex sets-based trilateration
algorithm** while representing IIT Madras in the 5th Inter-IIT Tech Meet14

# Intel
### Device Engineer | May 2021 - Present 

As a part of the Test Chip Integration team, I examine transistor performance and isolation structures in _RibbonFETs_ as a key contributor towards R&D efforts into Intel's future technology nodes. 

On a daily basis, I work on building and optimizing test structures that probe into process margins and performance gains for a given node/product. Being a device engineer, I enjoy analyzing I-V characteristics, developing leakage models, and understanding inherent process in novel transistor architectures.

**Projects**:
1. **Intel 18A** - Currently working on a **Pathfinding Test Vehicle** for Intel's 18A node which is due beyond 2025.
2. **Intel 3** - In my first test chip project, I was involved in an **Enchancement Test Vehicle** for the Alder Lake processors. My task was to develop experiments through Physical Design to study crucial device physics - strained channel, DIBL, off-state leakage - affecting drive current and gain of FinFETs in that node. Being at a relatively matured stage, this technology node was a good lauchpad for making the transition from academia to industry.
