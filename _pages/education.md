## Coursera
### Power Electronics Specialization

Offered by Prof. Robert Erickson of UC Boulder, the Power Electronics Specialization consists of 4 courses which helped me understand design of modern Switched-Mode Power Converters, create high-performance control loops, and magnetics design associated with these architectures. I completed the following courses as a part of this specialization -

1. Introduction to Power Electronics - [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/XGDKMK2PTVLD)
2. Converter Circuits - [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/AHHW3HX7VS5C)
3. Converter Control - [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/J8QXCGVXYN4G)
4. Magnetics for Power Electronic Converters - [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/S44TTBXFRG2P)

In addition to this, I've also picked up fundamentals of Digital System design through this course -
1. Digital Systems: From Logic Gates to Processors - [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/38UJ4JWX97PR)
